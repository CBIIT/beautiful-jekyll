### NCI CBIIT Workshop-1: 

**Using Machine Learning to Generate Molecular Descriptors for Drug Function Classification**
![Drug Function Classification](./../Img/MLDrugData.jpg)

#### Overview 
This workshop will introduce the concepts and tools to generate, explore small molecule (drug-like) 
chemical structures, compute chemical descriptors, create and analyze Machine Learning classification models. 
Open source chemoinformatics and predictive data analysis scikit-learn libraries will be used to 
compute key pharma-relevant descriptors and generate/analyze drug classification models respectively.

#### Agenda
Part 1 will be a 30-minute presentation followed by a 20-minute tools review. We will introduce ML concepts 
focused on creating molecular structures and extracting features or chemical descriptors. For molecular features, 
we will focus on molecular fingerprint descriptors and we will show how one can generate the traditional 
molecular properties. We will demonstrate the use of the following two tools for the exploratory data 
(chemical) analysis and feature generation:


* Rdkit libraries, Python’s open source cheminformatics software toolkit 
* Mordred and other open source software to generate molecular features 

Part 2 will include a 30-minute presentation followed by a 20-minute tools review. 
in Part 2, we will extend the concepts demonstrated in Part 1 to build machine learning 
classification models for predicting small-molecule (drug-like) function (ex., CNS, GI Agent, etc.). 
Tools include:

* Scikit-learn for creating Random Forest classification models 
* A modeling workflow that include data collection/curation, featurization  
(fingerprints), classification modeling using ensemble-based methods and analysis and based 
on the lessons-learned from [AMPL publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05211).
